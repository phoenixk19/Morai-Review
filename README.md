This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Environment & MongoDB

This project stores reviews in MongoDB. For local development create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:

MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-connection-string"
MONGODB_DB=morai

When deploying to Vercel, add the same environment variables in the Vercel dashboard for your project (Settings → Environment Variables). Do not commit `.env.local` — it's already ignored by `.gitignore`.

Notes:
- The API is located at `/api/reviews` and supports GET (list) and POST (create). POST body: { name, comment, audio? } where `audio` is an optional data URL for recorded audio.
- If `MONGODB_URI` is not provided the API falls back to an in-memory store for local testing only.
